# FPL_Statistics
Statistic webapp for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) managers coded in elm as a semestral work in course Applied Function Programming at FIT CTU. This application will be supported and updated throughout every FPL season I will be playing.

### Fantasy Premier League
[FPL](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life Premier League footballers and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play.

### Functionality and Usability
This project is made for all my friends who play this game with me. Its main goal is to help us analyze current form of Premier League footballers. This application will be consisted mostly of data tables and graphs. Since this is a long term project, all functionalities are not determinted yet, but will be created/updated by ideas of me and my friends.

This application will be using API made by FPL (it has no documentation) and other football statistics API.

### Similiar projects
Since millions of players are playing this game in the whole world, there are already many websites with similiar goal. Most famous is http://www.fplstatistics.co.uk/ and many others. Lot of websites force you to make an account or pay for their service. This project will be free, but for my friends only (so we will be in an advantage against other players :)).
